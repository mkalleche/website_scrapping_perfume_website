# Where to Find Database Password in Supabase

## ❌ You're Currently On:
**Storage → Files → Policies** (This is for file storage, not database)

## ✅ You Need To Go To:
**Settings → Database** (This is where the database password is)

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Look at the LEFT SIDEBAR** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Click on "Settings"** (it's usually at the bottom of the sidebar, under "PROJECT SETTINGS")
3. **Then click on "Database"** (under Settings)
4. **Scroll down** to find the "Database Password" section

## Alternative Direct Link:
Go directly to: 
```

```

## What You're Looking For:
On the Database Settings page, you should see:
- **Connection String** section
- **Database Password** section
- **Connection Pooling** section
- **Network Restrictions** (which you already saw)

## What to Do:
1. Find the **Database Password** field
2. Check if it shows `Aliparfum@99!!` or something else
3. If it's different, either:
   - Use the "Reset Database Password" button to create a new one
   - Or update your `.env.local` with the correct password

## Quick Navigation:
- ❌ **Storage** = For file uploads (where you are now)
- ✅ **Settings → Database** = For database password (where you need to go)
